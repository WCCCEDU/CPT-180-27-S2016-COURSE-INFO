  When it comes to discussing the difference between geek and nerd, we can start by looking at their definitions. According to Google, a geek is “an unfashionable or socially inept person.” Google also says that a nerd is “a foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious.” These definitions seem similar, but there is more that we can separate these two kinds of people by.

  When it comes to geeks, they are considered to be experts on a particular subject. In most cases, they are considered to be obsessive over that subject. They are also considered much more social than a nerd, but their discussions are usually focused around the subjects they are obsessed over. This is slightly different than how a nerd is.

  When we talk about nerds, we are talking about someone that usually keeps to themselves. They are generally much more introverted and they keep to themselves and their studies. Their activities will also reflect how introverted they are because they usually focus on stuff they can do alone like computer programming or chess.

  In my personal opinion the two terms are interchangeable. When I think of the two I do not differentiate. They both represent all of us smart people. The ones that understand the odd. Most people who find themselves using the terms are usually the ones that dont understand what we do or why we do it. They also choose not to be open-minded. 

  Sorry but i do not have 3 paragraphs of nerd knowledge. You may share anything you wish.

  In my humble opinion the differentiation between “Geeks” and “Nerds” can be varied by the person that you are talking to and the person making the judgment’s perspective. While both terms can be considered derogatory, recent times have found the labels as being more endearing and less condescending.
 
  In many circumstances the label of “Geek” and “Nerd” can be interchanged. In my opinion a “Geek” is more of an individual with an education and a goal that he/she is trying to achieve and he/she uses his/her education to achieve that goal.
 
  The “Geek” in my opinion is a functional “Nerd” because the “Nerd” in my opinion is someone that may appear to be educated, but is socially awkward. The “Nerd” in my opinion is less socially outgoing than a “Geek.”
 
  All of that being said, I don’t like putting labels on people, unless they label themselves. I have often been called a “Geek” and it doesn’t particularly bother me. I think that I am a Highly Functioning Geek.
