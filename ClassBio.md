  When it comes to discussing the difference between geek and nerd, we can start by looking at their definitions. According to Google, a geek is “an unfashionable or socially inept person.” Google also says that a nerd is “a foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious.” These definitions seem similar, but there is more that we can separate these two kinds of people by.

  When it comes to geeks, they are considered to be experts on a particular subject. In most cases, they are considered to be obsessive over that subject. They are also considered much more social than a nerd, but their discussions are usually focused around the subjects they are obsessed over. This is slightly different than how a nerd is.

  When we talk about nerds, we are talking about someone that usually keeps to themselves. They are generally much more introverted and they keep to themselves and their studies. Their activities will also reflect how introverted they are because they usually focus on stuff they can do alone like computer programming or chess.

  In my personal opinion the two terms are interchangeable. When I think of the two I do not differentiate. They both represent all of us smart people. The ones that understand the odd. Most people who find themselves using the terms are usually the ones that dont understand what we do or why we do it. They also choose not to be open-minded. 

  Sorry but i do not have 3 paragraphs of nerd knowledge. You may share anything you wish.

  In my humble opinion the differentiation between “Geeks” and “Nerds” can be varied by the person that you are talking to and the person making the judgment’s perspective. While both terms can be considered derogatory, recent times have found the labels as being more endearing and less condescending.
 
  In many circumstances the label of “Geek” and “Nerd” can be interchanged. In my opinion a “Geek” is more of an individual with an education and a goal that he/she is trying to achieve and he/she uses his/her education to achieve that goal.
 
  The “Geek” in my opinion is a functional “Nerd” because the “Nerd” in my opinion is someone that may appear to be educated, but is socially awkward. The “Nerd” in my opinion is less socially outgoing than a “Geek.”
 
  All of that being said, I don’t like putting labels on people, unless they label themselves. I have often been called a “Geek” and it doesn’t particularly bother me. I think that I am a Highly Functioning Geek.

  - Geek Vs Nerd       :

  Some copypasta from last semester. I took to the internet for this.

  A "Nerd" is considered to be a person who is very dedicated academically, very intelligent, but stereo-typically lacking in socialization skills. While they enjoy games, these are typically games or puzzles played in solitude. My favorite definition of the term I found online was "A four-letter word with a six-figure income" (urbandictionary.com). Also often described as the guy that will "be your boss someday."

   A "Geek" is a person who is also very dedicated to a specific subject, usually in the pop-culture world. They are die-hard fans of TV shows, movies, directors, video games, and the like. They may often quote, make references to, or relate life situations to media that they have seen, read, or played. They are usually part of a fandom. Geeks are typically considered more outgoing than nerds and are more accepted in social situations. A geek may consider him or herself part of a fandom.

  I am a little of both. &#X1f60a

  What is the difference between Nerd and Geek you may ask. Well there is how we socially act around people, what our future occupation will be , how we dress or look , and our interests. A little bit of background on how we perceive culture is based on where we grew up or where we lived as children. Some may say that if you grew up in front of the tv watching Star Trek or playing Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) as a highschooler you would be considered a nerd. On our other hand we have the people that take up one singular interest that they are experts in. This is what we consider as being a geek. Most people in our common culture believe that the nerd and the geek are the same thing so they use them interchangeably. Yet if you are one of these categories you would be furious to be called the other one. Our interests are a key point in how we are selected into our formal groups.

  Our interests can separate us from each other and create a reality that is immeasurable. A nerd is considered someone who goes to achieve something academically and loves complexity. So in saying this someone that creates a program that has to count the weight of a bucket of apples then figure out what the surface area of each one of those apples would be considered a nerd. Yet we consider someone that has one main interest in a topic as being a geek. We could see a geek that is interested in the ways of being a computer science master as being a nerd also because they would be interested in how to program this application. So in saying this we can see complexity and mastery as the difference between a nerd and a geek. To master something we must be intently interested in a single topic. So the complexity is talking about everything that is loved by a nerd creates a world that is ultimately complex. We can see complexity and mastery as parts of our entire attire.
  
  The attire of a geek or nerd can be seen as differentially the same. In geek culture we want to master one specific topic. Yet in the nerd culture they want too see themselves as a sophisticated group of individuals. When a geeks interests are in that of comics we can see them dress as though they were imitating their idol or their interest. So a geek would more than likely be wearing a batman shirt or maybe a Martian Manhunter jacket. Yet when we look at a nerd we see them as wearing a button down shirt with matching pants and dress shoes. So if we look back the nerd is the one that is wearing the more simple and less attractive style of clothing that shows the differences of their mentality to their style of dress. But then we look at the geeks who are the masters of their world and need to be the same way in their style of dress.

  - Geek Vs Nerd       :

  Throughout history, many people have stereotyped the words “geek” and “nerd” towards people who are different than the norm. A “geek” generally refers to people who are passionately in love with mathematics. Therefore, a “nerd” refers to people who are technically advanced with computers, such as designing programs and software. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are highly classified as computer “nerds”, while Albert Einstein is categorized as a math “geek”.
  
  Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are famous computer “nerds” because they constructed the first computer. They profoundly did this together inside of a garage as non-college students, and they eventually split into forming their own companies. Steve Jobs founded Apple, which he impressively designed his companies’ programs and software. Meanwhile, Bill Gates founded Microsoft, which he designed his programs and software too. Today, Gates and Jobs’ invention of the computer are reliable in society daily. The computer aids people around the world in communicating at a faster rate, rather than traveling. Overall, the computer allows people to achieve and create objects easier.
  
  Albert Einstein is a famous “geek” for his mathematical discoveries within the physics world. One of his famous discoveries is E = mc2. The variables represent different aspects of the universe. “E” is energy, “m” is mass, and “c” is the speed of light. With this, Einstein concluded that the speed of light is always constant. His inventions helped shape society’s overall understanding of the universe leading him to win a Nobel Prize.

  Even though “geeks” and “nerds” are closely related with being highly intelligent individuals, people misuse these words daily. People can distinguish between the two by looking back at the famous people in the world. Albert Einstein is a “geek” for his theories and discoveries, and Gates and Jobs are “nerds” for inventing the computer. “Geeks” discover things; “nerds” invent things.

  I think Nerd and geek can be used interchangeably. But, if i have to distinguish between the two a geek is more of a person that has a fascination with a particular subject and a nerd is a socially awkward person that experiences some geekdoms. Overall that are given negative connotations but they probably are not as bad as they should be.

  People generally use the terms "Geek" and "Nerd" interchangeably to describe a person who may be a little socially awkward or too intelligent for their own good.  These people don't know that there is a difference between the two terms, and that the person they use that term on doesn't take it as an insult unless they have used the wrong one.

  A person who can be labelled a "geek" is someone who is rabidly obsessed by every detail of a certain subject that is usually not considered mainstream.  For example, someone who knows the main characters in the cantina scene in Star Wars: A New Hope could be described as a Star Wars fan, however, someone who can identify even the background characters in that scene by name and back-story could be described as a Star Wars geek.

  A person who can be labelled a "nerd" is someone who generally strives to understand and educate themselves about things that are not common knowledge.  For example, someone who has to use Microsoft Excel for their job may learn how to do the necessary functions to create the desired spreadsheet, however, a nerd would research all of the functions and formulas to create a spreadsheet that is far more efficient.

  Now that "geeks" and "nerds" have been defined, and examples have been given as to how they are different than "normal" people, I will explain how they differ from each other.  Geeks usually have certain areas of expertise, whereas nerds try to understand the entire field.  A nerd might appreciate both Star Wars and Star Trek for what they have brought to the science fiction genre, but a geek will choose one to adore while despising the other.  While a nerd will try to understand the same subject as a geek, a nerd will never live and breathe that subject the same as a geek does.  There may be some differences between the two, and they may argue there is more, the truth also is that every geek is part nerd, and every nerd is part geek.

  To someone who does not know anything about geeks and nerds would consider them the same.  However, there are some differences between the two.

  Geeks are more of the pop culture when it comes to video games, cartoons, and fantasy shows.  They spend most of their time knowing trivia, going to conventions, and enjoying the new fancy tech that was released.  They also have careers more associated their fandom, such as animators and graphic designers.

  Nerds are more based in academics.  They put their efforts into achievements of the brain.  Their interests might be more into role playing games and complex shows.  This allows to be more aligned with jobs such as programmers, scientists, and engineers.

  Overall, there are subtle differences between the two, with most of the time a person can be both since the line between them can blur.

  I've never actually thought about the difference between geeks and nerds. I felt that there must be a difference since you asked so I did a random google search to see what I could find. The site that I chose is sparknotes.com . The site says that there are four main differences between the two. 

  One is that their interests are different. Geeks is associated with someone who has invested a lot of interest into one thing and is an expert at that one thing. They usually have more than one interest generally but they usually choose one that takes precedence over the others. Nerds on the other hand involve themselves in academia (math,science). So they are more interesting in games of strategy like dungeons and dragons etc. 

  Another difference the site notes is the difference in attire. Nerds are conservatively dressed (slacks, button down shirts, eye glasses out of necessity and not to make an ironic fashion statement. Geeks supposedly want to show a reflection of their interests so they will wear sneakers, jeans, and a graphic tee featuring a cartoon, movie or other intellectual property they enjoy. It also says that geeks can sometimes pay more attention to their interests rather than hygiene? I thought that was funny.

  Another difference is their occupations. Geeks tend to gravitate toward jobs that let them indulge in their interests. The site also says that geeks like to have fun while they work so they choose writing, graphic arts, or animation. Nerds supposedly seek jobs that benefit fromt heir devotion to all things academia and end up in fields like computer programming, scientists etc. 

  The last difference the site gives is a difference in social interaction, stating that geeks can sometimes be introverted and by extension not know how to respond approprately in conversation. It goes on to state that geeks are shown to react better to social stimuli and can get stuck in rants about their passions such as television shows or comic books.  I'm not sure how much truth there was to this article but like I said, I hadn't really thought about it before so it was helpful.
