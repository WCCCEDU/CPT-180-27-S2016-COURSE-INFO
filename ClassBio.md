  - Geek Vs Nerd       : 

  When it comes to discussing the difference between geek and nerd, we can start by looking at their definitions. According to Google, a geek is “an unfashionable or socially inept person.” Google also says that a nerd is “a foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious.” These definitions seem similar, but there is more that we can separate these two kinds of people by.

  When it comes to geeks, they are considered to be experts on a particular subject. In most cases, they are considered to be obsessive over that subject. They are also considered much more social than a nerd, but their discussions are usually focused around the subjects they are obsessed over. This is slightly different than how a nerd is.

  When we talk about nerds, we are talking about someone that usually keeps to themselves. They are generally much more introverted and they keep to themselves and their studies. Their activities will also reflect how introverted they are because they usually focus on stuff they can do alone like computer programming or chess.
