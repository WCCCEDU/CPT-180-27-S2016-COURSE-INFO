  When it comes to discussing the difference between geek and nerd, we can start by looking at their definitions. According to Google, a geek is “an unfashionable or socially inept person.” Google also says that a nerd is “a foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious.” These definitions seem similar, but there is more that we can separate these two kinds of people by.

  When it comes to geeks, they are considered to be experts on a particular subject. In most cases, they are considered to be obsessive over that subject. They are also considered much more social than a nerd, but their discussions are usually focused around the subjects they are obsessed over. This is slightly different than how a nerd is.

  When we talk about nerds, we are talking about someone that usually keeps to themselves. They are generally much more introverted and they keep to themselves and their studies. Their activities will also reflect how introverted they are because they usually focus on stuff they can do alone like computer programming or chess.

  In my personal opinion the two terms are interchangeable. When I think of the two I do not differentiate. They both represent all of us smart people. The ones that understand the odd. Most people who find themselves using the terms are usually the ones that dont understand what we do or why we do it. They also choose not to be open-minded. 

  Sorry but i do not have 3 paragraphs of nerd knowledge. You may share anything you wish.

  In my humble opinion the differentiation between “Geeks” and “Nerds” can be varied by the person that you are talking to and the person making the judgment’s perspective. While both terms can be considered derogatory, recent times have found the labels as being more endearing and less condescending.
 
  In many circumstances the label of “Geek” and “Nerd” can be interchanged. In my opinion a “Geek” is more of an individual with an education and a goal that he/she is trying to achieve and he/she uses his/her education to achieve that goal.
 
  The “Geek” in my opinion is a functional “Nerd” because the “Nerd” in my opinion is someone that may appear to be educated, but is socially awkward. The “Nerd” in my opinion is less socially outgoing than a “Geek.”
 
  All of that being said, I don’t like putting labels on people, unless they label themselves. I have often been called a “Geek” and it doesn’t particularly bother me. I think that I am a Highly Functioning Geek.

  Some copypasta from last semester. I took to the internet for this.

  A "Nerd" is considered to be a person who is very dedicated academically, very intelligent, but stereo-typically lacking in socialization skills. While they enjoy games, these are typically games or puzzles played in solitude. My favorite definition of the term I found online was "A four-letter word with a six-figure income" (urbandictionary.com). Also often described as the guy that will "be your boss someday."

   A "Geek" is a person who is also very dedicated to a specific subject, usually in the pop-culture world. They are die-hard fans of TV shows, movies, directors, video games, and the like. They may often quote, make references to, or relate life situations to media that they have seen, read, or played. They are usually part of a fandom. Geeks are typically considered more outgoing than nerds and are more accepted in social situations. A geek may consider him or herself part of a fandom.

  I am a little of both. &#X1f60a

  What is the difference between Nerd and Geek you may ask. Well there is how we socially act around people, what our future occupation will be , how we dress or look , and our interests. A little bit of background on how we perceive culture is based on where we grew up or where we lived as children. Some may say that if you grew up in front of the tv watching Star Trek or playing Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) as a highschooler you would be considered a nerd. On our other hand we have the people that take up one singular interest that they are experts in. This is what we consider as being a geek. Most people in our common culture believe that the nerd and the geek are the same thing so they use them interchangeably. Yet if you are one of these categories you would be furious to be called the other one. Our interests are a key point in how we are selected into our formal groups.

  Our interests can separate us from each other and create a reality that is immeasurable. A nerd is considered someone who goes to achieve something academically and loves complexity. So in saying this someone that creates a program that has to count the weight of a bucket of apples then figure out what the surface area of each one of those apples would be considered a nerd. Yet we consider someone that has one main interest in a topic as being a geek. We could see a geek that is interested in the ways of being a computer science master as being a nerd also because they would be interested in how to program this application. So in saying this we can see complexity and mastery as the difference between a nerd and a geek. To master something we must be intently interested in a single topic. So the complexity is talking about everything that is loved by a nerd creates a world that is ultimately complex. We can see complexity and mastery as parts of our entire attire.
  
  The attire of a geek or nerd can be seen as differentially the same. In geek culture we want to master one specific topic. Yet in the nerd culture they want too see themselves as a sophisticated group of individuals. When a geeks interests are in that of comics we can see them dress as though they were imitating their idol or their interest. So a geek would more than likely be wearing a batman shirt or maybe a Martian Manhunter jacket. Yet when we look at a nerd we see them as wearing a button down shirt with matching pants and dress shoes. So if we look back the nerd is the one that is wearing the more simple and less attractive style of clothing that shows the differences of their mentality to their style of dress. But then we look at the geeks who are the masters of their world and need to be the same way in their style of dress.
